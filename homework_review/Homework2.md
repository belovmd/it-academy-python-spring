## Homework2 review

### Homework2 evaluation
- Maximum score is +10 minimum is 0.
- Completed tasks 1, 3-5 are scored as +5.
- Completed tasks 6, 7 are scored as +1.
- 3+ completed **elementary** tasks from external sites scored up to +1,5.
- 2+ completed **advanced** tasks from external sites scored up to +2.
- +0,5 is my reserve :). 
- You don't need to make elementary tasks if you have advanced. In such case
they would be scored up to +4.
- PR that doesn't pass any of PR checklist checks takes -0,5.
- PR that doesn't pass any 2 of PR checklist checks takes -3.
- If external sites tasks doesn't contain full description they would not be
 checked (and would not be scored).
- All review comments should be addressed. Missed comments causes score 
penalties.

### Review notes:
1. Task 1. Can we use % operator instead of while? 
2. Task 3. Punctuation marks are: `,?.;:{)}['"` and some more.
3. Task 4. Redundant check for !=''.
4. You can add some advanced tasks to improve your scores (take a look at
 evaluation section)
5. Task 5. Why do we need to copy this string. More of that why do we do it 
with symbols iteration.
6. Redundant commented stings in tasks (prints, trivial descriptions etc).
7. Failed checklist item (PR name)
8. Missed tasks descriptions.
9. You can add some novice tasks to improve your scores (take a look at 
evaluation section)
10. Please divide tasks with two blank lines if you're doing them in one file
11. Failed CI checks
12. Missed tasks
13. Please don't remove `__init__.py` file.
14. Redundant comments in task (not only where I mentioned it in PR comments)
15. Task 5. We can just use `if 'a' < char < 'z'` or `char.islower()` function.
same for upper chars.
16. Please don't put your code to `__init__.py` file.
17. Task 6. There is one-line solution w/o temporary variable for creating next
fibonacci number.
18. Task 7. there is more simple solution (w/o number of digits count).
You can use knowledge after Numeral system lesson.
19. Other HW code in PR
20. Task 1. This task has one-line solution. It looks too complex.
